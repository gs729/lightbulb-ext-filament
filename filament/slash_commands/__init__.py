Filament provides an alternative, decorator-based implementation of slash commands as opposed
to the class-based system provided by hikari-lightbulb.

This implementation is more similar to the prefix/message commands implementation present in
hikari-lightbulb so may feel more familiar to you.

Creating a Simple Slash Command
===============================

Creating a simple slash command is very easy, and can be done in very few lines of code:

.. code-block:: python

    import filament
    import lightbulb

    bot = lightbulb.Bot(...)

    @filament.with_option(type=str, name="text", description="text to repeat")
    @filament.slash_command(description="Repeats the input")
    async def echo(context: lightbulb.SlashCommandContext) -> None:
        await context.respond(context.options.text)

    bot.add_slash_command(echo)
    bot.run()

"""
